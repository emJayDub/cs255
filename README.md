Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well?

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
-I would choose to improve the Sequence diagram to improve, by adding in if, else statements. This would add a layer of detail, and further clarification of what to happen when a hurdle is reached.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
-By understanding what the user needs and wants, designers can ensure that the system will meet those requirements and be more successful in achieving its purpose. The design should be intuitive and easy to use, making the user experience enjoyable and efficient. By incorporating the user's needs into the system design, designers can make sure that the system is designed with the end-user in mind, increasing the likelihood of user adoption and satisfaction.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
- Understanding the problem domain and the demands of the user is one of the most crucial aspects in the software development process. In doing so, requirements must be gathered, the issue must be examined, and use cases and user stories must be produced. Once these are determined, designers can begin building models of the system, such UML diagrams, to illustrate the components and interactions of the system.
-The design process often continues with the creation of a detailed design that outlines how the system will be implemented once the models have been created. This entails picking the proper frameworks, databases, programming languages, and libraries. It's crucial to think about how the system will be tested and maintained at this time.
